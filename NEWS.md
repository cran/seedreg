* Fixed error bar width failure. It is now possible to define the width of the error bars by the `width.bar` argument. By default, it makes the width equivalent to 0.01 times the mean of the independent variable. 

* RMSE (root mean squared error) value was added. 

* Added caption for `N_model` function 

* Added the variable `vel` to the `aristolochia` dataset. It represents the variable germination speed. The variable `resp` was changed to `germ`.
